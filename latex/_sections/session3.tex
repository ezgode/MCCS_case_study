\chapter{Dynamic programming}
	In this exercise, we tackle the trajectory planning problem through a dynamic-programming-based approach.
	Trajectory planning refers to the task of planning, in a certain temporary horizon. So, the obtained sequence of control inputs are applied to reach a certain control objective in an optimal way. 
	This is an important problem for autonomous vehicles because they must make control decisions considering specific navigation requirements such as obstacle avoidance and lane driving.\par
	%
	In particular, the problem is often solved in four steps as follows:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item a certain cost function is defined related to the control objectives,
		\item the current state of the vehicle and the range of valid control actions are used to predict the feasible trajectories which are supposed to be performed by the vehicle,
		\item each trajectory is evaluated according to the cost function,
		\item the best trajectory is selected out of the obtained pool of trajectories to be taken into account.
	\end{enumerate} 
	%
	In this exercise, we address a simplified version of the trajectory planning problem, and we obtain its solution, say, an optimal trajectory, using dynamic programming method. According to this simplified version, we assume that the first control input $u_1$ is fixed, while the second control input $u_2 \in\Omega = \lbrace u_{2,1}, u_{2,2}, \cdots, u_{2,n} \rbrace$ can take a finite set of values and change every $h$ seconds.\par
	%
	Regarding these assumptions, we build a graph representing the possible trajectories which can be followed by the vehicle.
	For example for a certain node $i$ representing the state $x_i$, we create $n$ new nodes $\lbrace x_k, x_{k+1}, \cdots, x_{k+n-1}\rbrace$ where the new states is computed as $x_{k+l} = x_{i} + \int_0^h f(x,u_1, u_{2, l+1},t) \text{d}t $ (with $f$ representing the non-linear model of the system).
	Once the graph is completed, we assign a specific cost to each node according to the cost function. Then, we traverse the graph in a backward manner to find the optimal trajectory. \par
	%
	The provided script and functions create the system graph and compute the state of the system at every node.
	For simplicity, a randomized heuristic is used to shape the graph in such a way that from each node, only some control inputs in $\Omega$ are taken into account to create the new set of nodes. 
	As already noted, you don't need to explore this feature of the script, however note that this heuristic parameter underlies obtaining different results in the course of consecutive executions of the script.

	\paragraph{Graph representation}
		We formally define the graph, then the cost assignment to nodes and the backtracking procedure to obtain the optimal trajectory are explained.\par
		%
		The graph $G = (N, E)$ represents the possible trajectories which can be followed by the vehicle. In particular, the set of nodes $N$ indicates different states which can reached from the vehicle's current position. The set of edges $E$ describes how the nodes are connected. 
		In the code, nodes and edges are represented by arrays \texttt{nodes}$\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times11}$ (here $n$ is the number of the nodes in the graph) and \texttt{edges}$\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times4}$.
		Each row $\texttt{node}_i$ of the \texttt{nodes} array is built as 
		%
		\begin{align}
			\texttt{node}_i = (i, t_i, \gamma_i, {\xPos}_i, {\yPos}_i, {\yaw}_i, \stat{1}, \stat{2}, \stat{3}, \stat{4}, \stat{5}), 
		\end{align}
		%
		that is, it contains the node id $i$, the time $t_i$ corresponding to the node, a flag $\gamma_i$, the position of the vehicle $({\xPos}_i, {\yPos}_i, {\yaw}_i)$, and its state $(\stat{1}, \stat{2}, \stat{3}, \stat{4}, \stat{5})$.
		The flag $\gamma_i$ is used to indicate whether the node has not been visited yet ($\gamma_i = 0$), has been visited and is a valid node ($\gamma_i = 1$), or has been visited and is a dead end ($\gamma_i = 2$); and it is used during the graph creation process (see Fig. \ref{fig:Graph}).
		A node is said to be visited when it has some successor node. 
		Otherwise, the node could be a dead-end (indicating that it violates the imposed constraints regarding lateral deviation form the path) or a non-visited node, which corresponds to the nodes at the tip of the branches of the graph.\par 
		%
		On the other hand, every edge $\texttt{edge}_i$ of the \texttt{edges} array in the form of 
		\begin{align}
			\texttt{edge}_i = (j, k, u_1^{j\to k}, u_2^{j\to k})
		\end{align}
		contains the ids of the nodes it connects ($j$ and $k$) in addition to the control input used during such a transition.

			\label {fig:Graph}
		\end{figure}
		It is worth noting that you will be given both the $\texttt{nodes}$ and $\texttt{edges}$ arrays and you will not be involved in calculating their elements. 
	\paragraph{Obstacles}
		To make the problem slightly more interesting, we consider not only the path tracking objective but also the avoidance of collisions with a certain set of static obstacles $\mathcal{O} = \lbrace o_1, o_2, \cdots, o_{n_{obs}}\rbrace$, where each $o_i\in\mathbb{R}^2$ contains the position information of the obstacle $i$.
	\paragraph{Node costs}
		In this exercise, we calculate the cost $c_k$ of a node $k$ as
		%
		\begin{align}
			c_k = c_j + c_{k,\text{path tracking}} + c_{k,\text{collision avoidance}} + c_{k,\text{dead end}}
		\end{align}
		%
		where 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $c_j$ is the cost of the predecessor node, 
			\item $c_{k,\text{path-tracking}} = w_{\text{track-d}}x_2 + w_{\text{track-heading}}x_3$ is a cost term associated with the path tracking error,
			\item $c_{k,\text{collision-avoidance}} = \sum_i^{n_{obs}} \frac{w_{collision-avoidance}}{dist(x_k, o_i)^3}$ is a cost term associated with the proximity of a node to some specific obstacles, 
			\item $c_{k,\text{dead-end}} = \infty$ if $\gamma_k = 2$ and $c_{k,\text{dead-end}} = 0$ otherwise. This cost term prunes dead-end nodes of the solution.
		\end{itemize}
	\paragraph{Backtracking}	
		Once the graph is built and the cost of each node is assigned, the optimal trajectory is backtracked. 
		In particular, we only need to identify the set of terminal nodes $\mathcal{N}_T = \lbrace i : \gamma_k = 0\rbrace$. Then, we select the one with the smallest cost $i^* = \arg\min\lbrace c_i : i\in\mathcal{N}_T\rbrace$. We later use the information in \texttt{edges} to explore the graph from $i^*$ in a backward manner by keeping track of the visited nodes, which will define the optimal trajectory.

\section{Exercises}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Copy your solutions of the methods \texttt{getInitialState}, \texttt{getSystemParameters}, \newline \texttt{getAllowedControlValues}, and \texttt{select\_reference\_path} from previous exercises. 
		\item Complete the method \texttt{getAllowedControlValues} which returns an array including all possible combinations of control inputs that can be applied to the system. 
			We assume that $u_1 = 3$ and $u_2 \in \lbrace -\pi/4, 0, \pi/4 \rbrace$.
		\item Complete the method \texttt{getObstacle} which specifies the positions of the obstacles to be considered. You can start by positioning the obstacle(s) in an arbitrary location, and once you  visualize the path to be tracked, you can refine the position of the obstacle so that it is on the vehicle's way. 
		\item Complete the method \texttt{assignCostsToNodes} which explores the graph in a forward fashion from the initial node. This method assigns costs to the nodes. 
			You can freely choose the values of the weights corresponding to the cost function, but the values you report must result in collision-free trajectories. 
			If you cannot find such a set of parameters, explain why. 
		\item Complete the method \texttt{backtrackNodeValues} which explores the graph in a backward manner to collect the sequence of the nodes which define the optimal trajectory. 
		\item Repeat the exercise for different sets of obstacles (changing the number of obstacles and their position). 
		Is the algorithm always able to find a collision-free path? Why? 
		\item Why is the graph creation process randomized from a certain point on?
		\item If you obtained unexpected results, discuss them.
